Dear Team,

I want to update you on the current team assignments. Phillip Allen will be leading the marketing team, while John Lavorato will handle the operations team. Jane Doe, our new hire, will oversee product launches. Mike Grigsby is coordinating with various departments.

Frank Ermis and Keith Holst are in charge of technical aspects, with Matthew Lenhart handling external communications. Jane Tholt will assist, and Jay Reitmeyer will join next month for sales strategies. Tori Kuykendall and James Steffes are responsible for customer relations.

We have Samantha Green, a new addition to the finance department, who will work with Phillip and Mike. Additionally, Chris Taylor will lead a team-building retreat next month.

In case of issues, contact me or any of the team leads. Avi Sharma will assist part-time and provide project support. We’re excited about the expansion and hope to collaborate smoothly.

Don't forget the final presentation led by Harsha Rao, which will be held on Friday, 14 May 2021. We hope for your full attendance.

We will meet at the library at 9:00 AM for rehearsals. Afterward, Thrisha Pagidi will host a discussion on feedback and improvements for future projects. Together, we will make great progress.
For any inquiries regarding these locations, feel free to reach out to our facilities manager, and they will assist with any logistical needs. Please note that we also have a backup office located at 1001 Pine Lane, Denver, CO 80202, in case of emergencies. This location will remain available until the end of the year. As part of our expansion, we are also in talks to open new branches in Los Angeles and Miami. 
Let’s work together and ensure we stay on track. Reach out if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Phillip Allen
