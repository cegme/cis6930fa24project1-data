A determined and athletic young woman with a fierce competitive spirit made headlines after leading India to triumph in the Women's Under-19 World Cup in Cape Town in early 2018. Priya Desai was born on April 10, 2000. Among a squad filled with seasoned players, Priya's passionate and fiery approach to the game made her a standout.

Rising through the ranks
She quickly moved up to the senior national team in early 2019, making her debut in a T20 series against Australia. In the absence of the regular openers, Priya was given the chance to showcase her skills and delivered several impressive performances, helping India clinch the series. Her consistent batting and strategic acumen earned her a permanent spot in the lineup.

At just 18 years old, Priya dominated in domestic leagues, clearly establishing her as a player of international caliber. During a tour of England later that year, she delivered a stellar performance, scoring a remarkable 120 runs in the final against England, securing her team's victory and leaving a lasting impression on selectors.

Solidifying her position
Following her debut, the selectors recognized her talent and continued to provide her with opportunities. Priya made headlines with her match-winning knock against New Zealand in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in 2020. Her partnership with fellow teammate Ananya Sharma, which included a 90-run stand, was pivotal in leading India to the finals.
