India has a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. One of the most significant events in Indian history was the arrival of the British East India Company in 1600. Over the years, the company expanded its influence, eventually leading to British rule. In 1857, the Indian Rebellion, also known as the First War of Independence, took place as a major uprising against British authority.

In 1915, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa and became the leader of the Indian National Congress. His philosophy of non-violent resistance, known as Satyagraha, mobilized millions of Indians to peacefully oppose British rule. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred on April 13, 1919, when British troops fired on unarmed civilians, leading to widespread condemnation of colonial rule.

One of the pivotal moments in Indian history was the Salt March, which began on March 12, 1930. Led by Mahatma Gandhi, this was a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt. Another critical moment came in 1942 with the launch of the Quit India Movement, which demanded an end to British rule.

Finally, on August 15, 1947, India gained its independence from British colonial rule, marking the end of over two centuries of foreign control. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of independent India. Following independence, India adopted its constitution on January 26, 1950, becoming a republic.

These events have shaped modern India, influencing its social, political, and cultural development over time, and the country continues to celebrate these milestones annually.
