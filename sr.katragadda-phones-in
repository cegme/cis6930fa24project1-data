Hi Team,

I hope you both are doing well. I wanted to follow up on the client call from earlier this week. As discussed, there are several important action items we need to focus on before the end of this month to ensure everything stays on track. One of the key takeaways from the meeting was that the client is concerned about aligning the deliverables with their internal audit schedule. They have requested a full report on the milestones by early next month, which is sooner than initially anticipated, so we will need to make some adjustments to our project timeline to accommodate this new deadline. 

Additionally, the client had some questions regarding the tax review team. They specifically asked for direct contact information to discuss a few pending issues related to regulatory changes. During the call, it was noted that the phone number previously provided may have been incorrect, so we need to ensure that we pass along the right information this time. The correct contact for the lead on the tax review team can be reached at (800) 427-5747. Alternatively, if that number is not available, they can also use the direct office line at 503-805-2117. It’s important that we get this information over to them as soon as possible to avoid any delays.

Another significant topic of discussion was the project budget. The client has expressed some concern about the costs associated with the final phase of the project. While they are generally satisfied with the work so far, they want to ensure that we stay within the agreed-upon budget for the remaining deliverables. I will be working closely with the finance team to monitor this and will provide updates accordingly. If we find that any budget adjustments are needed, we should schedule a follow-up call with the client to discuss these changes in more detail.

Lastly, I’ve attached the latest version of the project plan. Please review it and let me know if you see any issues or if further revisions are necessary. We want to make sure we are all on the same page before submitting the updated timeline to the client.

Let’s aim to have another internal check-in by the end of this week to ensure all action items are progressing as planned.

Best regards,  
Sam
