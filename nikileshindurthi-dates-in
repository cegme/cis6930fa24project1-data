Suzanne,
Greetings of the day. I hope this email finds you well. I'm a '97 graduate and interested in recruiting this year. However, I'm out 
in Portland, so I will be unable to attenfd any meetings in Houston. Let me 
know how I can help. I would like to go out there when you go. Let me know 
what our schedule is. Thanks.Bob Badeer The project officially kicked off on January 1st, 2022, with the first milestone set for March 15th, 2022. 
On April 30th, 2022, a mid-year review was scheduled to assess progress. By May 5th, 2022, the team had completed 60% of their tasks, well ahead of the June 1st, 2022 deadline.
However, by July 4th, 2022, unforeseen challenges pushed the next phase's completion date to September 10th, 2022. The final deadline was October 31st, 2022, but due to setbacks, the project was extended to November 15th, 2022.
Over the holidays, from December 24th, 2022 to January 1st, 2023, the team took a break. On February 14th, 2023, the CEO announced an updated schedule, aiming to finish the project by March 31st, 2023. Critical reviews were scheduled for April 5th, 2023, with the final presentation set for June 30th, 2023.
By mid-July, on July 15th, 2023, the company was ready to launch the new system. However, a last-minute delay pushed the release to August 20th, 2023. After a smooth rollout, the final sign-off occurred on September 30th, 2023, marking the end of the project. The official close-out meeting took place on October 1st, 2023, with the project deemed a success.
