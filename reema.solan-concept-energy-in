As part of our ongoing effort to manage and reduce operational costs, we encourage all employees to adopt more energy-efficient practices. Enron is committed to making a positive impact on the environment while reducing costs, and we need your help to achieve this.

Simple actions like turning off lights when leaving a room, using energy-efficient appliances, and optimizing heating and cooling systems can contribute significantly to our energy savings.

We will be hosting an informational session on energy conservation next Monday at the main auditorium. All employees are invited to join, and refreshments will be provided.

Thank you for helping Enron become a more sustainable organization.

Best regards,
Corporate Announcements
