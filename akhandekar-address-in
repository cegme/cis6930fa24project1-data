The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom. All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo. If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge. We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.
