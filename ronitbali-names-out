███:

I cannot make this stuff up. ███████████, the Senator famous for his
fight to protect the ██████████ Rate Payers, came to fame as the writer
of the Critically aclaimed film, █████████████████████████████. I
didn't believe it either until someone sent me this web page, with his
link attached to it. http://www.lexingtonnet.com/tomatoes/creators/index.htm

This page is dedicated to the three demented geniuses who brought us the 
Killer Tomatoes films!

██████████████ - Director/Writer

████████████ was the director of all four ███████████████ films. He also 
played small roles in each film, even playing himself in a few! He still runs 
many parts of ███████████████████████, I'm told. ? ███████████ - Writer/Actor

███████████ is probably best known in the ██ films as ██████, the dim-witted, 
parachute-wearing leader of the ███████████████. He also wrote 
parts of the films as well. Now, he's a state Senator, and even has his own 
page at http://www.stevepeace.net

? █████████████████████

Last, but definitley not least is ████████████. He's responsible for the 
entire concept of ███████████████! Like everyone else here, he played small 
parts throughout the films. Probably his best known was the kid in the 
library in the original film, who cleared out the room by merely saying 
"██████!". This little part was later used as a major character in the 
cartoon series.
