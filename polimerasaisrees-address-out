This morning's meeting of the Reliability, Availability, Quality, Price and Environmental Effects Committee of the Governor's Energy Policy Work Group was primarily an opportunity for TVA to present their position in the current energy climate.

TVA had at least six representatives at the meeting.  Four of the TVA representatives gave presentations on the issues being considered by this committee.

TVA was asked whether the interest in Tennessee for merchant power plants was directly related to the RFP issued by TVA in January 2001.  This RFP is for 600 MW to be sold to TVA beginning in 2004.  TVA responded that it was possible that only one plant would be used to provide the 600 MW, and that the dozens of plants being planned in Tennessee would not be selling electricity to TVA.  This led to comments from the committee that most of these plants would not materialize once TVA awarded the RFP.

Incidentally, TVA stated that 80 proposals had been received in response to the RFP, and the companies still on the short list of contenders for the RFP have been notified, although TVA did not disclose the names of the short-listed companies.  TVA added that the company chosen from the RFP would not be required to have the plant fully permitted at the time of the award.

Economic and Community Development Deputy Commissioner, Tony Grande, the committee's other co-chair, said the committee may schedule another meeting after the September 26th public comment meeting to hear from the merchant power companies in a setting similar to the setting of today's meeting.
