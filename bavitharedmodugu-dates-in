Dear Team,

As we prepare for the upcoming project launch, I want to outline some important dates. First, our kickoff meeting will be held on Monday, 10 May 2021. This will be a crucial meeting, so I encourage everyone to be prepared. Following that, we have a mid-project review scheduled for 21 June 2021. This will give us an opportunity to adjust our plan if needed.

The final project submission deadline is set for Friday, 30 July 2021. Please ensure that all tasks are completed by this date. If we encounter any issues or delays, we will schedule an additional meeting on 15 August 2021.

I know that many of you have vacations planned during the summer, so we will also be discussing holiday schedules during our next meeting on 25 May 2021. It is essential that we manage our time effectively, especially with the project launch coming up.

Lastly, I would like to remind everyone about the companyâ€™s annual retreat, which will take place from 5 September 2021 to 10 September 2021. I look forward to seeing you there.

Please also keep in mind that the finance department will review the project budget on 12 April 2021. Additionally, our annual performance evaluations are scheduled to begin on 1 December 2021. Be sure to prepare all necessary documents before these dates.

Please confirm your availability for the following meetings and deadlines: 10 May 2021, 21 June 2021, 30 July 2021, 15 August 2021, and 25 May 2021.

Best regards,
Project Manager
