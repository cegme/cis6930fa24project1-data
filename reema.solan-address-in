Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The financial and insurance details provided on the back of this page, along 
with the information below, constitute a Summary Annual Report for the Enron 
Benefit Plans. Each plan's annual report has been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as mandated by the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE: You might receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you have no entitlement. Eligibility for benefits 
under any of the plans is determined by the provisions of each plan.

Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to request and receive a copy of the complete annual 
report, or any section thereof, for any plan. For insured plans, insurance 
details (including any commissions paid by insurance carriers) are included 
in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the complete annual report, or any section thereof, for 
any plan, please write or call:

Enron Corp
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002-7311

You also have the right to request from the plan administrator, at no charge, 
a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and accompanying notes, 
or a statement of income and expenses of the plan along with accompanying notes, 
or both. If you request a copy of the full annual report from the plan administrator, 
these two statements and notes will be included as part of that report.

You are also legally entitled to review the annual report at the main office 
of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002-7311) and at 
the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to obtain a copy from the
