Hi Team,  

I hope this email finds you well. We’ve been working through the details for the audit, and there are still a few key items that require our attention before we can consider everything finalized. As you know, our goal is to ensure everything is wrapped up smoothly and on time. We are targeting December 2000 for the completion of the final report, as discussed during our previous meetings. This should provide us with adequate time to review and address the remaining issues flagged in the tax documentation. Some of the flagged items are minor, but there are a few significant concerns that we’ll need to address before moving forward.  

One point of concern is the legal review that Mark mentioned in his last email. He believes that the regulatory changes that took effect on 07-12-01 might require an additional round of adjustments to our forecasts and projections. This is something we will need to keep an eye on, as the updated regulations could impact some of our tax filings for the upcoming quarter. To ensure we remain fully compliant with the new rules, I would recommend that we involve the Legal team sooner rather than later. They will be able to provide us with the necessary guidance to avoid any missteps that could lead to delays or further complications down the road.  

Another issue that came up during our recent discussions is the status of the data validation for the financial reports. Please make sure to review the attached materials, which include the latest updates on this front, and let me know if you have any concerns or questions. I’m particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on how we should handle the discrepancies that were identified.  

We’ll plan for a final review of everything by early December, allowing us enough time to make any last-minute revisions if needed. Let’s aim to have a follow-up meeting early next week to discuss the open items and how we can move forward efficiently.  

Best regards,  
Dave
