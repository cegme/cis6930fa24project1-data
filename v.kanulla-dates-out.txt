Subject: Birthday Party Plans

Hello Michael and Emily,

I'm planning a birthday party for my daughter, and I'd love for you and your kids to join us. It’ll be on █████, starting at 2 PM, at our home: 123 Maple Avenue, Springfield, IL 62704. There will be games and activities for the kids, including a magician and a bouncy castle.

Please let me know if you’re bringing any of your kids so we can prepare enough food and drinks. If you need directions, feel free to call me at (312) 555-7890 or my husband, James, at 312-555-1234.

Best,
Sarah Johnson

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the invite! I'll bring my two boys, Lucas and Ethan. They’re very excited about the party, especially the bouncy castle. Just to confirm, it's at 123 Maple Avenue, Springfield, right? Also, should I bring anything?

Best,
Emily
