I am still researching the January 2000 data, but I thought you could look over the other months and get back to me with any questions. The tax details for the months after January show some discrepancies, particularly with regard to production taxes, which seem to be higher than initially projected. This might be due to the policy changes that were introduced last year, but I’ll need more time to investigate further. I have also noticed some inconsistencies in the application of the Ad Valorem taxes across different fields. Some regions seem to have higher valuations despite lower production outputs, which doesn't align with the expected results. I will dive deeper into the documentation for those months to find any potential errors or overlooked factors. We’ll need to make sure these discrepancies are addressed before the audit next month. 

John mentioned in our last meeting that the calculations for the March data were not aligning with the field reports. The production volumes from the North and South regions appear to be correctly logged, but the tax rates applied seem off. I spoke with Sarah earlier today, and she agreed that we should flag this for review. Tom is also going to assist in rechecking the figures for February, especially the numbers tied to the Westfield operations. Westfield had some abnormal production levels last year, which could be contributing to the inconsistencies we're seeing in the tax assessments. Between John, Sarah, and Tom, we should be able to identify the root cause of these discrepancies. 
Additionally, Sarah has brought up concerns about how the recent changes in the state's tax policies are impacting our projections. She believes we may need to revise the tax models we’ve been using for forecasting, especially since the state is now implementing higher rates in certain districts. I’ll be working closely with her to ensure the data for the first quarter is adjusted accordingly. John also suggested that we reach out to Mark in Legal to clarify the application of some of these new tax regulations.

In the meantime, if you have any specific areas of concern, feel free to point them out. I’m happy to prioritize those as needed, especially if they pertain to regions or months that might have a larger impact on our overall numbers. Ensuring that all these figures are accurate is critical as we prepare for the upcoming audit. We need to present clean, consistent data, and I want to avoid any last-minute surprises during the review process.

Please review the attached data, and let me know if there are any areas where you need additional clarification or if you would like me to focus on specific discrepancies. Any feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,  
Dave
