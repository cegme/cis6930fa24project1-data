Jane,

I wanted to follow up on our discussion regarding the upcoming quarterly earnings report. We need to finalize the numbers by **December 15, 2000**, to meet the reporting deadline.

Please ensure that all departments submit their updates by **December 10, 2000**. This will give us enough time to compile the data and prepare the report.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
John
