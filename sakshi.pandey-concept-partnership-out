To: Ken Lay and Joe Sutton;

First let me say that I heartily applaud the move you recently made in
regard to oil and gas exploration and production. I feel somewhat
vindicated in the position that I had previously taken with EOG
management when I suggested selling off the domestic operations and concentrating on
the foreign opportunities. My real satisfaction, however, is in the
retention by Enron Corp. of both the China and India operations. I
believe that I have expressed to both of you that the concept of an integrated
gas company was very appealing to the officials in both countries.
Particularly in China, this concept appeared to be a factor in the success of our
negotiations.

I am a bit concerned, however, by the reports I receive from some of my
friends and former colleagues in CNPC.████████████████████████████

I have complete faith that Enron Corp. will resolve this matter in good
time and not allow it to jeopardize, in any degree, the great potential
that Enron has in China. Nevertheless, if there is any way in which either
I or my colleague, Johnny Kopecky, can be of any assistance we stand ready
to do so.██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

determining the true nature and extent of the problem, if there should
indeed be one.

Again, congratulations on what you are doing with Enron. And many
thanks for the steady increase in the valuations of my Enron stock.

Regards,
Lindsey Lipscomb
