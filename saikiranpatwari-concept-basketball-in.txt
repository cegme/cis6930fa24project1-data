>    The All-State Basketball Tournament is just around the corner, scheduled
> for December 5-10, 2002, at the Downtown Arena. This year, we have over 30 teams
> competing, including last year’s champions, the Springfield Falcons and the Riverview
> Eagles. The tournament will feature exciting matchups, including a rematch between 
> Springfield’s star player, Jordan Blake, and Riverview’s top scorer, Marcus Lee.
>
>    On December 6, 2002, we will host a special coaching clinic with NBA legend 
> Patrick James, who will provide insights on advanced zone defense strategies and 
> fast break techniques. The clinic will be followed by a Q&A session with high school 
> coaches and college scouts. This is a great opportunity for both players and coaches 
> to learn new techniques and gain valuable insights into modern basketball tactics.
>
>    The game schedule includes key matchups such as:
>      - Springfield Falcons vs Riverview Eagles (Dec 5, 7:00 PM)
>      - Downtown All-Stars vs Hillcrest Bears (Dec 6, 5:30 PM)
