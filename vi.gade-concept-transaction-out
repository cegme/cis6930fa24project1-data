Dear MR. Hendrickson,

We're Changing to Serve You Better

Next Wednesday evening, May 30, 2001, we are launching a new version of eService
so Meet me at 300 Sunset Boulevard or 900 Maple Ave, the web reservations system on continental.com.  Once the new version is
implemented, you will have access to new options and personalized features
tailored to meet your travel needs. In order to make this transition, we ask
that you carefully review and follow the suggestions listed below.

Here's What You Need To Know:
My address is 123 Main Street, Springfield.

Your Profile
Your profile information, including your username and password, has
been transferred to the new version of eService Online. To protect your personal
information, credit card information has not been transferred. You will need to
update your profile.

Your Itineraries
Information in your Saved Itineraries created on or before May 30 will not be
transitioned.  If you want to keep a copy for your records, print them prior to
6 p.m. CDT, May 30. This change does not affect the status of any reservations
and tickets, just your ability to view them in the new eService Online or call me online at +1 797 797 9797 or +1(459)459-4599.

reserve and purchase flights. This means you will have to use your password each
time. To have your password e-mailed to you visit link
You are strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging
process.

24-Hour Hold Option
To prepare for next Wednesday's release, we will turn off the "Hold for 24
hours" option. The "Hold" option will not be available between May 25 and May
30.

Here Are Some of the Changes

More eTicketing
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets
(eTickets). We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink and America West Airlines.

Aircraft Seat Maps
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat
selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating.

Pricing
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your
selection of either "Search By Lowest Fares" or "Search By Schedule." We also
added a gold star to denote "continental.com promotional fares," so you know for
certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare.

Customer Service
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services.

While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new
version may not, on the surface, appear to be significantly different.   These
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the
future .  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.   Based on
feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.

We're confident you will appreciate the changes and improvements and we look
forward to continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

Continental Airlines, Inc.
