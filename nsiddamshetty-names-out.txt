Florida’s primetime contest against Kentucky marked the first time in program history that the Gators started a pair of true freshmen at both quarterback and running back. 
With redshirt senior signal caller ████████████ out for the season with a torn ACL and senior running back ███████████████████ sidelined with a lower body injury, the Gators were forced to turn to backup freshman quarterback █████████ and freshman running back ███████████ to carry the load.
Moreover, the two rising stars delivered – and in a major way. 
In what many touted as a must-win game for Florida (4-3, 2-2 SEC) to maintain its path to bowl eligibility, the Gators came away with a massive 48-20 victory against Kentucky (3-4, 1-4 SEC) at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday. 
██████ and █████ accounted for over 75 percent of Florida’s offense, with the true freshman duo in the backfield picking up 365 of UF’s 476 yards.
“We had a vision for what they could accomplish here, person, student and player, and a ton of people contributed to that,” UF head coach ████████████ said. “For ███████████ to observe Montrell Johnson since January, for █████████ to observe ████████████, that impacted tonight as much as anything.”
In the days leading up to Florida’s contest against Kentucky, questions remained unanswered regarding ██████’s ability to compete against a high-level SEC defense. As soon as he took to the field, however, Florida’s freshman signal caller made it clear that he was ready for the bright lights of SEC play.
After starting the game with a 13-yard first down scramble, ██████ found sophomore wide receiver █████████████ on a perfectly placed 40-yard lob down the middle of the field. From there, the Gators’ offense stalled out, but Florida still managed to get on the board first, via a 29-yard field goal from junior kicker ██████████.
