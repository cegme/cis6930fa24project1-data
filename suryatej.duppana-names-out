████ received several calls today from different clients. One of them, █████, called him from her personal number, which was +1-202-555-0173, while discussing the upcoming project. Shortly after, he got a message from █████, who sent him his office number as (202) 555-0198. ████ noted both numbers in his contact list but was distracted by a meeting reminder.

Meanwhile, █████ from the UK reached out to confirm the latest contract details. Her number was listed as +44 20 7946 0958. She asked if they could arrange a meeting next week. Afterward, there was a missed call from an unknown number: 202-555-0156. ████ couldn't recognize who it might be, so he made a note to follow up.

Later in the day, ████’s manager, ████, asked him to update the team’s contact sheet. She shared her number, which was 555-0164. Though it was a local number, ████ had it saved without the area code. Another teammate, ███████, reached out from his new line, +61 2 9374 4000, to provide feedback on the presentation slides.

Later that evening, ████’s family in India tried to get in touch. His cousin’s number, +91 98765 43210, came up on the screen, reminding him that he needed to call back. ████’s brother, who lives nearby, also left a voicemail. His local number was (987) 654-3210, which ████ saved to return the call later.

During all of this, ████ had a few other communications as well. He received a call from the company hotline, 555-123-4567, and a promotional text from a service with the number +33 1 44 44 22 22, which was based in France. As the day came to an end, ████ realized he had over 10 different phone numbers saved, many of which were in different formats.
