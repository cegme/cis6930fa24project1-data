Thanks for your response.  I have two initial comments/questions:

1.  I don't understand "D" in the formula shown in # 2 for AAF.  What is it,
how it is determined?  If D and M exclude MO, SO, and Force Majure, what is
left for "D"?

2.  If TVA only has rights to 4 of the 6 units, how would gas imbalance
charges be handled if both TVA and Enron are supply gas for the total plant?
Certainly there will be situations were units trip or fail to start, etc.
which will lead to imbalances.
