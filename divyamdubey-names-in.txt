Cheryl & Jay,

The captioned counterparty has already received our preferred templates as same were included with our ISDA draft sent to Andrea Murphy Haydon @ DEP under my cover letter of 5/20/2001.

The Enron Corp. Guaranty and DEP's parent Guaranty (Consolidated Natural Gas Company) were each for an amount of $50M.

Jay,

You may want to call your DEP contact and inform them this effect.


Cordially,

Veronica: I have attached two form guarantees for both CNG and Enron.  The
guarantees are identical except for the identities of the guarantor and
beneficiary.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I can be reached at (840)
819-2286.

Sincerely,

Mark Murray
